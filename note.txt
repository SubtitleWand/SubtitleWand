Found a strange issue about file_picker not working in this project, but new project. 
The solution for the project is to 
1. upgrade hover version,
2. use clear cache
3. hover run

I don't know why, but It might be download error or something...? Hopefully clear cache did the job.

***SRT file containt \r\n, will affect dart to calcualte per line...
